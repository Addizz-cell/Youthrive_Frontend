                <p>In my previous material post, i talk about reading ahead. This course outline will help you use your time wisely.</p>
                <h1>My advice</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li style="color: blue;">use the books, videos and learning websites to read ahead. <b>Face only the topic of the next class</b></li>
                    <li style="padding-left: 20px;" style="padding-right: 30px;">if you do not understand a concept or topic, please write down your questions ahead of the class</li>
                    <li>during the class, pay attention to see if I will answer the question. If a don't ask your question. Your prepared questions can help others gain a better understanding of the topic. <b>Remember</b>: Just like in Math, In Programming there are many ways of solving a problem. My approach might be different from the one you saw elsewhere. <b>However</b>, optimization or lines of codes makes the difference</li>
                    <li>If you don't read ahead, it might make each topic seen <strong>difficult</strong>  and will lead to <strong>discouragement</strong> </li>
                    <li>Aim to understand all the topics covered within a week because you  will need to remember  or apply what we learnt in the previous weeks to better understand the next class, complete your classwork or project on time and better debug your code</li>
    
                </ul>
                <p> <b>Remember</b>: When you <b>forget much</b>, you will <b>understand less</b>. <i>Say no to procrastination</i> and distractions. <b>There is no sweet without sweat</b>
